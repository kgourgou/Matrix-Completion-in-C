Matrix Completion in C
============================

This repo contains a **very naive** implementation of the singular value thresholding algorithm for matrix completion done as part of a project for a numerical algorithms class. 


Parallel version is not very sophisticated and just uses OpenMP to scatter some of the for-loops among available processors.
